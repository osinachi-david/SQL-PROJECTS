-- To check for a pattern 
-- USE THE LIKE OPERATOR 
-- 2 wildcards are used with the LIKE operator: % and _
-- % represents 0, 1 or Multiple characters 
-- _ represents a SINGLE character 

--Ex
select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%'

select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A___'

select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE '__A%'

--First Names that start with C and end with S
select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE 'C%S'

-- select all last names starts with A and are at 
-- least 5 charaters long
select * from Employees
where LAST_NAME LIKE 'A____%'

--Defining string ranges
select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME between 'AL' and 'D'

-- MORE WILDCARDS 
-- [] THIS MATCHES CHAR WITHIN THE BRACKETS 
-- ^ THIS MATCHES ANY CHAR NOT IN THE BRACKET
-- - REPRESENTS A RANGE OF CHARACTERS 

--EXAMPLES
select FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A_[^madl]%'

select * from Employees
where FIRST_NAME LIKE 'C[a-z]%'

--EXISTS Operator 
-- used in queries where the query result depends on whether or 
-- not certain rows exist in a table. It evaluates to TRUE if 
-- the subquery returns at least one row 

--Example
select * from Departments
where exists 
		(select * from Employees
		where Employees.DEPARTMENT_ID=Departments.DEPARTMENT_ID)

select * from Departments

-- SQL joining Tables 
-- when you query two or tables at a time and get a combined 
-- result set it's referred to as joining 

--types 
-- full join, inner join, outer join, cross join 

--SQL INNER JOIN 
--it is the most common type of join 
-- it returns only those rows that have a match in both 
-- joined tables 

--Example
select 
Departments.DEPARTMENT_ID, Departments.DEPARTMENT_NAME,
Employees.EMPLOYEE_ID, Employees.FIRST_NAME, Employees.SALARY,
Employees.JOB_ID
from Departments
inner join Employees ON
Departments.DEPARTMENT_ID = Employees.DEPARTMENT_ID

-- outer joins 
--( left outer join, right outer join, full outer join)
-- they return the rows even if they don't have related rows
